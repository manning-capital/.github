# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Glyn, a mathematics enthusiast with a deep passion for probability theory and its applications in quantitative finance. Welcome to my personal research organization where I explore the intersection of mathematical rigor and algorithmic trading. This is where I dive into the probabilistic foundations of financial markets and build trading systems grounded in solid mathematical principles.

## What I'm Building

This is my learning laboratory where I'm diving deep into quantitative trading through the lens of probability theory. I'm currently focused on developing algorithmic trading strategies, building backtesting frameworks, and exploring how mathematical concepts from probability theory can be applied to financial markets. Think of it as my sandbox for experimenting with statistical arbitrage, risk management, and market analysis.

## Current Focus

Right now I'm particularly interested in statistical arbitrage and machine learning strategies grounded in probability theory. I love exploring how random variables and distributions model asset returns, how expectation and variance help assess risk, and how conditional probability and independence inform portfolio diversification. I'm fascinated by stochastic processes for modeling price movements, martingales in option pricing, and Bayesian inference for updating beliefs about market conditions. I'm always learning new techniques and approaches to make sense of market data and build robust trading systems.

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss quantitative trading concepts, collaborate on research projects, or just chat about the fascinating world of algorithmic finance. Feel free to reach out!
